 <h1>Astronomers</h1>
    <h2 id="subtitle">A one-page roleplaying game about discovering planets</h2>
<p>You sit at a comptuer terminal, recieving feedback from your telescope and deepspace satellite in a remote location. You crack your knuckles, poised over the keyboard. There are entire galaxies out there, you just know it.</p>

    <h2>What you'll need to play</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>A standard 52-card deck</li>
        <li>A six-sided die</li>
        <li>Post-its</li>
        <li>Pencil</li>
        <li>Workspace</li>
        </ul>
<!--        <p><i>All materials are also available digitally. Just use the "PLAY NOW!" button at the bottom.</i></p>-->
    
    <h2>How you play</h2>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p><i>Astronomers</i> is a cooperative roleplaying game. The goal is to discover all the nearby planets and stars, and discover the stories of those out of your world.</p>
        <p>At the end of the game, you'll have discovered stories about planets no one's ever discovered. This works as a great world-building exercise for any role-playing game.</p>

        <h3>Getting Ready</h3>
            <p>Turn order is determined with whoever looked up at the stars most recently going first. If there's a tie, then it's whoever can point closest to North. Then play continues clockwise.</p>
            <p>Players start by shuffling the deck. Each card will represent a celestial body, so the deck itself represents all the observable celestial objects in this corner of the universe from your vantage point with your telescope. Similarly, the workspace represents the scope of your telescope since the workspace is the only place you can put cards during the game.</p>
            <p>After the deck is shuffled, hand it to the player going first.</p>
        
        <h3>On your turn</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Deal one card from the deck face down. The card is normally from the top of the deck but it can come from anywhere in the deck. This represents the randomness and chaos of the universe.</li>
            <li>Place the card anywhere on the workspace and roll the dice.</li>
            <li>Flip over the card and, using the <a href="#tables">dice and card value tables listed below</a>, determine what type of celestial object you've just discovered.</li>
            <li>Establish your findings in two sentences: "Our studies show" and "Legend has it."</li>
                <ol>
                <li>"Our studies show..." (and then list the size, attribute, and life hospitable levels) [Eg, for the Ace of Diamonds with a roll of 4: "Our studies show that this celestial body is a <b>medium-sized planet,</b> <b>that's completely icy</b> yet <b>very hospitible to life</b>.]</li>
                <li>"Legend has it..." (and then invent a mythos around the planet. This can be anything at all!) [Eg, for the Ace of Diamonds with a roll of 4 (see above): "Legend has it, though, that the planet is actually very small inside, and 80% of its size is pure ice."]</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Then it's time for the <b>Press Room</b>. All other players can ask the current player up to 2 questions to learn more about the object they just discovered. Whatever that player says is the final word on the celestial object. <a href="#pressRoomQuestions">There are some sample questions below</a>. </li>
        <li>Make sure you take notes about the celestial object on the post-it note so all players remember what the object is.</li>
<li>Your turn is over, play continues clockwise.</li>
        </ol>    
        <h3>Revisiting previous discoveries</h3>
            <p>If a player believes there's more to be discovered about a celestial object than initially thought, they can <b>revisit a celestial object</b>.</p>
            <p>Now that player draws a card, but <i>must place it on top of the current card on the workspace that they want to revisit</i>. Now that celestial object has <i>both</i> attributes, and the <b>Press Room</b> reopens for questions from other players.</p>
            <p>If the card drawn is the same value as the old card, that means the attribute is doubled. For example, if a player drew the Two of Hearts then revisited it and drew the Two of Spades, and "two" represents "fire", then that object could potentially explode, go supernova, etc; basically, the fire is much stronger than initially anticipated.</p>
            <p>This is a very loose mechanic, and players are welcome to adapt it to how they see fit. Maybe if a distant spaceship was discovered, perhaps it's moved to somewhere else in the workspace, etc.</p>
        
        <h3>Ending the game</h3>
            <p>Gameplay ends once all the cards are drawn.</p>
            <p>In the end, the workspace could be covered in cards and post-it notes as well as stories that span solar systems.</p>
            <p>Players are encouraged to recount the tales they told. The map can then even work for a table-top RPG in space!</p>

        <p><i><b>Table of card values</b></i>: Use the table below to determine the attribute of the celestial object you drew for.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind, the player who placed the card decides on what kind of life is on the planet, what the mythos is, etc. Consider the table below as suggestions; players are encouraged to improvise within reason, keeping the game fun for everyone.</p>

            <li>Could you tell us more about the mythos of this planet? How did you hear about the legends?</li>
            <li>Do you believe the legends are true about that planet?</li>
            <li>These two celestial objects are really close to each other. How do they impact each other's gravities? Do they have cultural impacts on each other? Can you see any spaceships flying from one to another?</li>
            <li>Can you determine the trajectory of the huge spaceship you just discovered?</li>
